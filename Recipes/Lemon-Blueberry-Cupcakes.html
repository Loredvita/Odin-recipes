      <li><div class="instrucion">Step 1</div></li>
     <p>Combine frozen blueberries, sugar, and lemon juice for jam in a small pot over medium heat; bring to a simmer. Cook, stirring occasionally, until mixture has reduced and thickened, about 12 minutes. Remove from the heat.</p>
     <li><div class="instrucion">Step 2</div></li>
     <p>Pour mixture through a fine mesh sieve, pressing solids to extract as much jam as possible; you should have approximately 1/4 cup. Discard any solids and refrigerate jam until completely cool, at least 30 minutes.Pour mixture through a fine mesh sieve, pressing solids to extract as much jam as possible; you should have approximately 1/4 cup.

     <li><div class="instrucion">Step 3</div></li>
     <p>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line 18 muffin cups with paper liners.</p>
     <li><div class="instrucion">Step 4</div></li>
     <p>Whisk flour, baking powder, and salt for cupcakes together in a small bowl.</p>
     <li><div class="instrucion">Step 5</div></li>
     <p>Cream sugar and butter together in a large bowl until light and fluffy. Beat in eggs, 1 at a time, mixing well after each addition. Mix in lemon juice, lemon zest, and vanilla until combined. Add flour mixture in 2 batches, alternating with buttermilk, beating batter just until combined after each addition; batter will be somewhat thick.</p>
     <li><div class="instrucion">Step 6</div></li>
     <p>Place frozen blueberries in a small bowl and toss with flour until coated. Add to the batter and fold to incorporate. Spoon batter into the prepared muffin cups, filling each one 3/4 full.</p>
     <li><div class="instrucion">Step 7</div></li>
     <p>Bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes. Check to see if a toothpick inserted into the centers comes out clean, and continue to bake, if needed, for 4 to 8 more minutes. Cool in the pans for 5 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely, about 20 minutes more.</p>
     <li><div class="instrucion">Step 8</div></li>
     <p>While the cupcakes are cooling, remove blueberry jam from the refrigerator. Measure out 1/4 cup for the frosting and reserve any extra for another use.</p>
     <li><div class="instrucion">Step 9</div></li>
     <p>Beat butter for frosting in a large bowl until creamy and smooth. Add 1 cup powdered sugar, lemon zest, lemon juice, and salt; beat until thoroughly combined. Add 1/4 cup blueberry jam and mix until combined. Add 1 cup powdered sugar and mix until smooth. Repeat with remaining 1 1/2 cups powdered sugar. Add heavy cream and beat until frosting is smooth and fluffy, 1 to 2 minutes more.</p>
     <li><div class="instrucion">Step 10</div></li>
    <p>Frost cooled cupcakes.</p>
    </ol>
  
    <p class="instrucion title">Cook's Notes</p>
    <p>Do not defrost the blueberries before using. Using frozen blueberries chills the cupcake batter more than usual, which results in a slightly longer baking time. Be sure to start checking the cupcakes for doneness after 20 minutes, as bake times may vary.</p>
     Don't use more than 1/4 cup jam in the frosting or it may break (meaning it will look soupy or curdled).
